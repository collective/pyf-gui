  <h1>About this service</h1>

  <p>We are aggreating all Plone related packages from PyPi and enhancing it with
  statistical data from GitHub. This allows people to find Plone add-on's easier
  and decide what to use and in which versions. The data from PyPi is updated
  once an hour and the data from GitHub every night.</p>

  <p>If you think we can improve something or found something not working, please let us know by opening an issue here:</p>
